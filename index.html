             <h3>Language Attribute</h3>

            <p>The charset declaration must be included completely
            within the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#charset">first 1024 bytes of the
            document</a>
            and should be specified as early as possible (before any content that could be
            controlled by an attacker, such as a element) in order to avoid a
            potential <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/doctype-mirror/wikis/ArticleUtf7.wiki">encoding-related security
            issue</a>
            in Internet Explorer</p>

            <h3>Meta Description</h3>

            <p>The description meta tag provides a short description of the page. In some
            situations this description is used as a part of the snippet shown in the search
            results.</p>

            <p>Google's <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35624?hl=en#meta-descriptions">Create good meta
            descriptions</a>
            documentation has useful tips on creating an effective description.</p>

            <h3>Mobile Viewport</h3>

            <p>There are a few different options that you can use with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dkx3qtm_22dxsrgcf4"> viewport meta
                tag</a> "Viewport and
            Media Queries - The Complete Idiot's Guide"). You can find out more in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag"> the MDN
            Web
            Docs</a>.
            HTML5 Boilerplate comes with a simple setup that strikes a good balance for
            general use cases.</p>

            <p>If you want to take advantage of edge-to-edge displays of iPhone X/XS/XR you
            can do so with additional viewport parameters. <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/7929/designing-websites-for-iphone-x/"> Check the WebKit
            blog</a> for
            details.</p>

            <h3>Open Graph Metadata</h3>

            <p>The <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph Protocol</a> allows you to define the way your
            site is presented when referenced on third party sites and applications
            (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). The protocol provides a series of meta elements
            that define the details of your site. The required attributes define the title,
            preview image, URL, and <a href="https://ogp.me/#types">type</a> (e.g., video, music,
            website, article).</p>

            <p>In addition to these four attributes there are many more attributes you can use
            to add more richness to the description of your site. This just represents the
            most basic implementation.</p>

            <p>To see a working example, the following is the open graph metadata for the HTML5
            Boilerplate site. In addition to the required fields we add to
            describe the site in more detail.</p>

                 <h3>The Content Area</h3>

                 <p>The central part of the boilerplate template is pretty much empty. This is
                    intentional, in order to make the boilerplate suitable for both web page and web
                    app development.</p>
